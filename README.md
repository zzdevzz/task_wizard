# Recipe Search API https://taskwizard.devcreates.com/
#### The purpose of this project was to practice React and build an API from scratch.

#### This website acts as to-do list with a simple belief They should be more fun, hence the exciting theme. Motivate yourself to carry on forward.

#### Excuse if the code has a lot of comments, I'm still learning and it helps me remember my thought process.

### Familiarized myself with: 
> - JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for Stateless Authentication.
> - Building a RESTFUL API from scratch to handle CRUD operations.
> - Securing database inputs with model validations.
> - Using Serializers to control JSON data exposed to frontend.
> - React.js Hooks (State, Effect, Context)
> - Asynchronous API (async/await)
> - JSX, components, props, css modules, etc.
> - Exposed to Framer Motion and CSS animations for smooth responsive transitions.

(React.js, JavaScript, HTML, CSS/Bootstrap, Ruby, Rails, deployed with Heroku)
