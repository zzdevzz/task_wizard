1. JWT & Axios & React:

Look into using cookies in future and reaching tokens straight from cookies. Too much time spent trying to be smart passing token as context, axios interceptors does not like being updated with React variables. Old tokens being passed.














Goods:

Use Axios to check for 401 and logout.
