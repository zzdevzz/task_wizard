1. JWT & Axios & React:

• Look into using cookies in future and reaching tokens straight from cookies. 
• Too much time spent trying to be smart passing token as context, axios interceptors does not like    
   being updated with React variables. Old tokens being passed.
• Look into Active and Refresh Tokens.













Goods:

• Use Axios interceptor purely to check for 401 and logout.
